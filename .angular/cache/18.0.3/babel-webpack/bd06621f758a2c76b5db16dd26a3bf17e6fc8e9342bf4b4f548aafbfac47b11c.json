Moreover, to ensure the visibility of these results, I created visually compelling visualizations that mapped the distribution of these tweets across the United States. \");\n          i0.ɵɵelementEnd()();\n          i0.ɵɵelement(167, \"hr\", 25);\n          i0.ɵɵelementStart(168, \"div\", 20)(169, \"div\", 21);\n          i0.ɵɵtext(170, \"Comparative Analysis of CNN Architectures for Brain Tumor Classification Using MRI Datasets\");\n          i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n          i0.ɵɵelementStart(171, \"div\", 24);\n          i0.ɵɵtext(172, \" This project explores the efficacy of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures in the classification of brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets. Brain tumors, critical indicators of severe health issues, necessitate precise classification for effective diagnosis and subsequent treatment planning. Given the complexity of tumor manifestations in MRI scans, this study aims to determine the most effective CNN architecture that enhances diagnostic accuracy in neuroimaging. The project involves a systematic comparative analysis of multiple CNN models, including both baseline and pre-trained networks via transfer learning. We assess these models based on a comprehensive set of performance metrics\\u2014accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC curves, and confusion matrices to identify the superior model. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to medical diagnostics by improving the reliability of brain tumor classification, thereby supporting timely and appropriate clinical
